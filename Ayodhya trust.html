        <h1 class="log">AYODHYA TRUST</h1>
        <p>The Ayodhya dispute is a political, historical, and socio-religious 
            debate in India, centred on a plot of land in the city of Ayodhya, 
            Uttar Pradesh. The issues revolve around the control of a site regarded 
            since at least the 18th century among many Hindus to be the birthplace of 
            their deity Rama, the history and location of the Babri Masjid mosque at 
            the site, and whether a previous Hindu temple was demolished or modified to 
            create the mosque.The site of the Babri Masjid has been claimed to be the 
            birthplace of Rama since at least 1822. In 1855 local Muslims became convinced 
            that the nearby Hanuman Garhi Temple was built over the site of a former mosque, 
            and became resolved to demolish the temple, resulting in violent clashes leading 
            to the deaths of many Muslims. In 1857, a chabutra (platform) was erected in the 
            courtyard of the Babri Masjid at the supposed site of Rama's birthplace. As a consequence 
            of this dispute was a court case in 1885 requesting the construction of a temple to enclose the 
            chabutra, considered to mark the birthplace of Rama, in the courtyard of the Babri Masjid, which 
            was rejected. This was followed by Hindu riots in 1934 following a cow slaughter which damaged the 
            Babri Masjid. In 1949 devotees of Rama placed idols dedicated to him in the mosque, and the structure 
            was subsequently declared off-limits to Muslims.The Babri Masjid was destroyed during a political rally 
            on 6 December 1992, triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent. Many attempts were 
            thwarted previously, one of which led to the 1990 Ayodhya firing incident. A subsequent land title 
            case was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. 
            In the judgment, the three judges of the Allahabad High Court ruled that the Ayodhya land be divided into 
            three parts, with one third going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Rama represented by the Vishva Hindu Parishad, 
            one third going to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, and the remaining third going to Nirmohi Akhara, 
            a Hindu religious denomination. While the three-judge bench found no evidence that the mosque was constructed 
            after demolition of a temple, it did agree that a temple structure predated the mosque at the same site</p>
       <div class="gol"><h2 class="log1">Beginnings of dispute</h2></div>
       <p>The first recorded instances of religious violence in Ayodhya occurred in the 1855. Certain "Sunnis claimed that 
        the Bairagis of Hanumangarhi had destroyed a mosque that existed atop it. The Muslims charged on the Hanumangarhi 
        but were repelled and routed. They hid inside the mosque of Babur that lay at a distance of less than a kilometre 
        from Hanumangarhi. The Babri mosque was attacked by Hindus in the process. Since then, local Hindu groups made 
        occasional demands that they should have the possession of the site and that they should be allowed to build a temple 
        on the site, all of which were denied by the colonial government.In 1946, an offshoot of the Hindu Mahasabha called Akhil 
        Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha (ABRM) started an agitation for the possession of the site. In 1949, Sant Digvijay Nath of 
        Gorakhnath Math joined the ABRM and organised a 9-day continuous recitation of Ramcharit Manas, at the end of which the 
        Hindu activists broke into the mosque and placed idols of Rama and Sita inside. On 22–23 December, idols were installed 
        inside the mosque and the people were led to believe that the idols had 'miraculously' appeared in the monument.Jawaharlal 
        Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel insisted that the idols should be removed, however, Govind Ballabh Pant was not willing to remove 
        the idols and added that "there is a reasonable chance of success, but things are still in a fluid state and it will be hazardous 
        to say more at this stage". By 1950, the state took control of the structure under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, 
        not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site. The mosque had been converted into a de facto temple. Both the Uttar Pradesh 
        Sunni Central Waqf Board and the ABRM filed civil suits in a local court staking their respective claims to the site.
        
        Christophe Jaffrelot has called the Gorakhnath wing of Hindu nationalism 'the other saffron', which has maintained its existence 
        separately from the mainstream Hindu nationalism of the Sangh Parivar. After the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) was formed in 1964 
        and started agitating for the Babri Masjid site, the two strands of 'saffron politics' came together.[66] While the lawsuits 
        continued in 1950s and 1960s, the Ayodhya dispute took a new shape in 1984 when the VHP carried out procession in Ayodhya, seeking</p> 
       
       <div class="gol"><h2 class="log1">Dispute Between Babri Masjid  &  Ram Janma Bhoomi</h2></div>
        <p>At the centre of the row is a 16th-Century mosque that was demolished 
            by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people.
            Many Hindus believe that the Babri Masjid was actually constructed 
            on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders.
            Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when 
            some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols.
            Over the decades since, the two religious groups went to court many times over 
            who should control the site.</p>

            <h4><b>Allahabad High Court verdict</b></h4><hr>
            <p>The Babri Masjid was not the first demolition. There used to be 
                a Ram Mandir in the place which was demolished to make a mosque. 
                A subsequent land title case was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, 
                the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In the judgment, 
                the three judges of the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) 
                of Ayodhya land be divided into three parts, with 1⁄3 going to the Ram Lalla or 
                Infant Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha, 1⁄3 going to the Uttar Pradesh 
                Sunni Central Waqf Board, and the remaining 1⁄3 going to Nirmohi Akhara. The 
                judgment affirmed that the disputed land was the birthplace of Rama as per evidence 
                provided and that the Babri Masjid was built after the demolition of a Hindu temple, 
                noting that it was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.

            <h4><b>Title Cases</b></h4><hr>
            In 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad filed a title suit with the Allahabad High Court seeking 
            injunction to offer puja (worship) at the disputed site. A similar suit was filed shortly 
            after but later withdrawn by Paramhans Das of Ayodhya.[7] In 1959, the Nirmohi Akhara, a Hindu 
            religious institution,[8] filed a third title suit seeking direction to hand over the charge of 
            the disputed site, claiming to be its custodian. A fourth suit was filed by the Uttar Pradesh Sunni 
            Central Waqf Board for declaration and possession of the site. The Allahabad High Court bench began 
            hearing the case in 2002, which was completed in 2010. After the Supreme Court of India dismissed a 
            plea to defer the High Court verdict,[9] on 30 September 2010, the High Court of Allahabad, the three-
            member bench comprising justices S. U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D. V. Sharma, ruled that the disputed 
            land be split into three parts. The site of the Ram Lalla idol would go to the party representing Ram 
            Lalla Virajman (the installed Infant Rama deity), Nirmohi Akhara was to receive Sita Rasoi and Ram Chabutara, 
            and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to receive the rest. The court also ruled that the status quo 
            should be maintained for three months.[10][11] All the three parties appealed against the division of disputed 
            land to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court held final hearing on the case from 6 August 2019[14] to 16 October 
            2019.[15] On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust (to be formed by 
            the Government of India) to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give 5 acres of land to the 
            Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque as a replacement for the demolished Babri Masjid.

                <h4>Gahadavala period</h4>
                <p>After the Guptas, the capital of North India moved to Kannauj and Ayodhya fell into relative neglect. It was revived by 
                    the Gahadavalas, coming to power in the 11th century CE. The Gahadavalas were Vaishnavas. They built several Vishnu temples 
                    in Ayodhya, five of which survived till Aurangzeb's reign. Indologist Hans T. Bakker concludes that there might have been 
                    a temple at the supposed birth spot of Rama built by the Gahadavalas. In subsequent years, the cult of Rama developed 
                    within Vaishnavism, with Rama being regarded as the foremost avatar of Vishnu. Consequently, Ayodhya's importance as a pilgrimage 
                    centre grew. In particular, multiple versions of Ayodhya Mahatmya (magical powers of Ayodhya) prescribed the celebration of Ram 
                    Navami (the birthday of Rama).</p>
